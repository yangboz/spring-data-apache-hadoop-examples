- Go to the root directory of project (The one which contains the pom.xml file)
- Create the input directory to HDFS and move the files found from etc directory to that directory.
- Configure the input and output directories found from application.properties file.
- Run command mvn clean assembly:assembly
- Go to the target directory
- Unzip the mapreduce-bin.zip to the preferred directory
- Go to that directory
- Run the startup script (startup.bat or startup.sh)
